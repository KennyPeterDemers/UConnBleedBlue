    <p>Hi {{Name}},</p>

    <p>Announcing the 3rd Annual Bleed Blue with Andy - Football Alumni Tailgate against UAB on Saturday November 1st.
    I am planning our biggest and best “Bleed Blue with Andy Tailgate”.
    In order to make that happen, I need you to: Go to &nbsp;&nbsp;www.UConnBleedBlue.com &nbsp;&nbsp;ASAP to register to our football alumni mailing list
    and request your complementary tickets. Complementary tickets will be handed out at the tailgate.</p>

    <p>Even if you can't make the tailgate, please register to our mailing list.
    The site also contains a link to a great article about how Coach B is still going strong.</p>

    <p>
    The sooner I know how many of you are attending the game / tailgate, will allow me to better prepare the menu for our tailgate.
    I’m trying to make it a real feast.</p>

    <p>Don’t forget to donate to Andy’s Fund.
    Just follow the directions on the web site or bring cash for our “cookie jar” on game day.
    You can also mail me a check at: <br><br>Kenny Demers <br>16 Brookfield Rd. <br>West Hartford, CT 06107</p>
    
    <p>No donation is too small. Currently approximately $500.00 has been donated. My expenses usually run about $2500.00
    All money donated above the cost of the tailgate goes directly into Andy's UConn Football Alumni Fund.
    As usual, you can expect a thank you call or hand written thank you note from Coach B.
    Currently, I accept online donations via Venmo, Cash App, and Apple Pay.
    If you need another online method, let me know and I'll try to set it up.</p>

    <p>I wish you all continued good health and look forward to sharing a great day with you.</p>

    <p>— Kenny</p>

        Thank you for all that you do for the Bleed Blue Nation of UConn Football!

        I never had you as a coach, but I know you as a man of UCONN!

        The insight you displayed in holding ourselves accountable for our action was your main focus as our mentor during the age of consciousness and your ability to align our role as a student athlete made you grow up fast on the UConn campus.

    <p>
        Our alumni has an asset that is cherished that no other school in the country can have. For over 40yrs you have me coming back to UConn from NJ and every time I see you, you have at least 10 stories to tell that are very memorable that I may have forgotten but you keep those experiences alive. Thank you for being a mentor, coach and friend over the years.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether you are connecting with alumni with student athletes for the job events, locker room visits, spring practice visits, cards to wish me well will always make me smile. You do this for 1,200 Alumni!! Nobody does that across the country! Thank you for your friendship, inspiration and indelible mark you continue to make on our program. Bringing the alumni together at special events and games always welcoming us back to UConn has been very special to us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you for being there for all of us! Look forward to seeing you at the tailgate!

        Coach,
     </p>
    <p>
        Even though I’ve never been on a football field for a single snap, some how I got an invitation to participate in this football tribute. I wouldn’t ever pass up the opportunity to let you know of the immense impact you’ve had in my life. So, I’m grateful for the chance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aside from my parents, nobody has had a more profound influence than you. You got my dad the job at East Catholic before I was even born for God’s sakes!  Seriously, you’ve been there for me every step of the way. I wouldn’t be the head coach at UConn without you. I wouldn’t have played at UConn either. You are responsible for much of my success professionally.
    </p>
    <p>
        More poignantly, you’re responsible in large part for the man I’ve become. Your lessons remain prevalent in my life…
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        There isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about how you would handle a situation.  And, I truly want to honor you with all I do as your successor. You really do have big shoes to fill!
    </p>
    <p>
        I pray that I will have half as positive an impact that you’ve had in your life. The number of people you’ve positively touched is impossible to equal. I once thought an effective person must make enemies. I no longer believe that, because you’ve never made one.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m grateful you are still in my life and so happy your football family is appropriately honoring you.  All those whom you’ve touched owe you a debt of gratitude. You’ve given us a model of a man whose faith and family are at the center of his life and the golden rule is how you lead. We are all proud to follow. God bless you Coach Baylock.

        I’m so glad they’re taking the time to honor you at the football game.  You have impacted so many lives and helped carve a path for so many.  When I first arrived at UConn at the age of 25, you immediately became a father figure to me.  It was an intimidating time, and you always had a nice pep talk to keep me on track. I remember our many talks in my office, it was nice to know I could always turn to you for guidance, no matter what the situation was!  You supported me as a Head Coach who was also raising a family and for that I am forever grateful.  I smile every time I get to see and talk to you at an event.  You truly are a legend and UConn is so lucky to have you.

        When I first arrived at UConn at the age of 25, you immediately became a father figure to me.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was an intimidating time, and you always had a nice pep talk to keep me on track.
    </p>
    <p>
        I remember our many talks in my office, it was nice to know I could always turn to you for guidance, no matter what the situation was!
    </p>
    <p>
        You supported me as a Head Coach who was also raising a family and for that I am forever grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
        I smile every time I get to see and talk to you at an event.
    </p>
    <p>
        You truly are a legend and UConn is so lucky to have you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Love you! Enjoy your special day!

        I worked with Andy for 37 years, and the first thing that comes to my mind is that he has been the “Mentor of Mentors”.
    </p>
    <p>
        I didn’t ask to talk to Andy when I first came to UConn to coach the Track and Cross Country teams, he basically told me to come to his office the first week I was on the job as a 29 year old Head Coach.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I left his office that day, I had a friend for life, a confidant, a cheerleader and an inspirational character who never let me down.
    </p>
    <p>
        A MENTOR.  Open and honest, he always shared his thoughts, his coaching techniques and his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the years I can’t even imagine how many other “Mentors” he has impacted.
    </p>
    <p>
        I just know that this Mentor could never have been the Coach that I became without the friendship and guidance provided by the Master of the Mentors, Coach Baylock!!

        Dear Coach,
    </p>
    <p>
        While the entirety of sport is amazing and fills life with memories, there are a few special moments that stand out differently from the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometime around April of 2007 or so, you pulled me aside after a CPIA awards dinner in the Rome ballroom after I had the opportunity to present a couple of awards to student-athletes in my cohort. You complimented my messaging and emphasized the importance of showing genuine care for our student-athletes.
    </p>
    <p>
        That may have been the first time we spoke. I was early in my career, still holding onto my 20s for dear life, and I didn’t know much about anything. I knew immediately, however, that your words would stay with me forever.
    </p>
    <p>
        You didn’t have to take time out of your night to do that, and I was genuinely honored… and a little starstruck. We hadn’t really interacted before, and you were THE Coach Andy Baylock everyone talked about; the one everyone respected, the one everyone knew cared about them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your endless value of people, education, growth, kindness, and sending these young Huskies into the world one day ready to bring good is all that is fundamentally right about college sport.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am grateful beyond measure that our paths have crossed so many times over the last nearly 17 years. When I see you, I instantly remember what’s really important. I know it’s about the people, about the kids, about sincerity, about love for what you do and love for the folks around you. I know that it’s about family, and honor, and authenticity….. and then celebrating the victories along the way isn’t so bad either.
    </p>
    <p>
        Coach, thank you for everything you bring to every seemingly little moment. I promise you, those moments are huge.
    </p>
    <p>
        Love,

        Dear Coach Baylock,
    </p>
    <p>
        Having attended an American high school in Germany, I met you first on campus when the freshman team reported in 1969. Aside from your reassuring ways, what I remember most was your no-nonsense approach to academics. You helped me register for the same kinds of classes as all incoming students, implicitly emphasizing that I was there to be educated. Your letter to the parents of incoming players bespoke a commitment to education and the ideals of sport: to develop character through shared sacrifice and self-discipline in order to prepare for life. While my athletic contributions were limited, the discipline I learned by facing adversity and by finishing what I started has helped me greatly in achieving other goals over the years.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every time I see you, I remind you that I feel like an imposter on alumni rolls because I only played freshman ball and scarcely saw the field, yet you always make me feel a part of the team.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a college professor for more than four decades at a university that invests heavily in its football program, I have long lamented the absence of those values that you first instilled in us. A letter from a football coach to his players extolling the virtues of reading would simply be unheard of on campuses today. We were lucky to be under your tutelage, Coach. Many thanks for the lessons you taught.

        I can never thank you for all you have done for me and my family over the years. In August of 1970 I entered into your freshman program along with 120 other players. At that time I had no idea how much you would do for me over the next 50 plus years. You have been a coach, teacher, mentor, colleague, advisor, and most of all a valued friend.

    <p>
        Congrats to you!……..When I first arrived at UCONN it was overwhelming for me: Big  Stadium, complicated plays, both on offense as well as defense, discipline to be on time, don’t be a moment late!  Study Hall, plus being away from home. Make no mistake, you had to  UP your game! But no matter how frustrated I got, there was always one person I could rely on to get me back on track, both, mentally and physically. Yes it was you, Andy, with your smile, pat on the back and your winning, get organized attitude! I thought of you often when I was in Viet Nam and how great it would be to get home to UCONN and ANDY B”s winning ways.

        When I arrived on campus in Storrs in the fall of 2006 it was only the second time I’d ever been to the State of Connecticut. The first was during freshman orientation. While I visited the football facilities and met some of the coaches and staff during orientation, I didn’t earn a roster spot as a walk-on until a few weeks later. When I did, Rasool Ahmed made sure that I knew who you were. As a walk-on from Kansas City, Missouri, there wasn’t a ton of incentive for you to be so engaged in my experience as a football player at the University of Connecticut, but you were. Whether it was chatting about Rasool, Kansas City bbq, or even my girlfriend at Seton Hall who you’d heard about because one of your friends was in their athletic department and she worked for the basketball team, you managed to maintain a relationship with a young man who wasn’t on scholarship, from halfway across the country. The lesson in your experience at UConn is that people and relationships are the most valuable things we can possess. I took the lesson to heart, and my career in government affairs and lobbying has been the direct result of valuing people and fostering those relationships. For that, I say, “Thank you.” The last time we were able to catch up, you gave me a tour of the new UConn campus with a developed downtown, bus depot, and more restaurants during my era. When I see you again, it will be to congratulate you on all your achievements at the home opener on August 31st.  I’ll end this letter with a couple of quotes that apply to your impact on me and the University of Connecticut.
        “You can easily judge the character of a man by how he treats those who can do nothing for him.” – Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

        Dear Coach,
    </p>
    <p>
        Greetings from the fastest player to ever wear UConn gear. Andy Baylock, you could possibly be the greatest man to ever walk the earth. You have done so much for the maturation of a lot of us former UConn players, and continue to keep us in the loop after 20 years. You are a great person, friend and a legend!

        It was August 27,1973, about ten a.m.. It was double session football, first day in pads. It was already 98 degrees on the way to 103. Humidity hung in the air like artillery smoke. We were a bunch of scrubs in the huddle, waiting for instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whistles and hollering, grunting and the sounds of helmets hitting pads.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sweat and heat like a sauna, we were silent, hot and miserable, just hanging on.
    </p>
    <p>
        You came to our huddle and asked us, “Who wants to have fun?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “We do !” We replied in one voice, hopeful of some respite or reprieve.
    </p>
    <p>
        “BE THE FUN !” you said with a smile and left us to ponder that thought.
    </p>
    <p>
        In that moment I learned a life lesson I never relinquished. Best advice I ever heard in my entire life. Be the fun!
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank, Coach for all the encouragement, dedication and inspiration. You made it fun, and you always had our back. We have been blessed with you in our lives, then and now.

        Coach:
    </p>
    <p>
        I have been organizing this event for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now it’s my time to tell you why. It’s not about UCONN, football, or baseball, but about feelings. Everyone has feelings that change over the years. Every one of us has had our highs and lows. We have all had challenges, but anyone that has been fortunate enough to have had contact with you has been in receipt of something special – unconditional friendship and love. The coolest thing about it is, I did not know when it was going to happen. It could have been a dreary Saturday and I went out to my mailbox and there is a hand-written postcard with a “Hi Kenny” at the top. Or maybe, it would be mid-morning and I am in my cellar/office working at my computer and my cellphone rings and I glance at it and see “Andy”. Or it could be a sunny day and I get the mail. I open an envelope to see a picture of my 18-year-old self in my UCONN uniform. Suddenly, I forget my aches and pains and the current issues in the world and remember what a blessed life I’ve had. There may be other great people in the world like you, but they haven’t crossed my path yet. Thank you for being in my life.
    </p>

        Love,

        I don’t think there will ever be a way to get across how much you mean to the University of Connecticut and our football team. During a time of so much change and growth for all of us, you were always there to lend a hand, share your wealth of knowledge, and point us in the right direction.

        You guided us during our early days at UConn to make sure we would get the most out of our UConn experience. And once we left to go out to the real world, you kept in touch to help maintain our Husky connection with your newsletter and special notes from time to time. The fact that you still remember our names and hometowns when we meet at the football game day tent is amazing. You are the epitome of bleeding blue and we are thankful to have your mentorship and happy that UConn football is honoring you. Thanks for all you’ve done for us.  Go Huskies!!

        I clearly recall your commitment to the football program and the players when I played for you back in the ’60’s, the era of the “Spear Tackle.”

        Your kindness and caring is what struck me and to no one’s surprise you have never wavered. I still marvel at you hand-writing all of those messages and notes to us over the years.

        You are an amazing human being Coach, and I want to thank you for all you’ve done for me and all of the players you have coached over the years. I am so sorry I can’t attend your celebration, but know that you occupy a very special place in my heart.

        Dear UConn Alumni;
    </p>
    <p>
        To say that I’m a proud member of the UConn Football Alumni would be an understatement. I am always grateful to be able to attend a gathering of the Alumni at Storrs and or the Rent.
    </p>
    <p>
        The “Farewell To Memorial Stadium” this past Saturday, was as much fun and as special as all the previous UConn Football Alumni Events I’ve been fortunate to attend.
    </p>
    <p>
        As I was driving back home to NJ that evening, I reflected on the day and the festivities. It carried the same theme of all the many previous events I’ve attended. Greetings from many former Alumni, listening to the speakers recall how we all feel about the place that brought back so many memories. Rich [Foye] portrayed a vision of looking at memories of the Stadium through the lens of a camera. A very appropriate way to look at the history of what was special to all fun. Phil Barry and coach Naviaux also made poignant thoughts. All this is wonderful, however…………    </p>
    <p>
        I’d like to add a vision I had that had been missed last Saturday, and quite frankly at most of the Alumni events. A constant image in this vision [if you look through Rich Foye’s video clip analogy] is one man that personifies UConn Football. A man that was so unselfish in his reaching out to us as players and young men. And now as grown men, he continues to reach out to us again in a way that makes each of us feel special. We ALL know that man…..Andy Baylock!
    </p>
    <p>
        Rewinding the film from Memorial Stadium and then playing it back over the decades, there is Andy guiding players and coaches through those many memories.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wins, big pays and outstanding efforts by those who stood tall at Memorial Stadium occurred under Andy’s watch.  Andy was and is always there over the decades to the present time to help make us who we are.  There have been outstanding Head and Assistant coaches at UConn that have had guided us on the field, but Andy continues to do it through out our adult lives. How amazing is it that we all are fortunate to have this great man give so much to those of us who have passed through the Storrs campus.
    </p>
    <p>
        Andy Baylock is a “gift” to all who know him. He is what we aspire to and believe in. We all are grateful for the goodness and kindness he shares with us each time we see him.
    </p>
    <p>
        Think about the moment you greet Andy. A warm handshake, a big bear hug, that smile and most of all he remembers a special moment, a play, an anecdote, a highlighted event from the past about what you did at UConn. He does that with such ease, without hesitation and with conviction for hundreds of former players and coaches. Andy jokes about not using computers, smart phones and emails. He doesn’t need it!  He’s got everything stored on his own “hard drive” – the brain God gave him.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why rely on a machine, he carries everything upstairs – where it counts!
    </p>
    <p>
        Andy does it all “under the radar” quietly building an Alumni Family of former players, coaches and support staff and doesn’t expect an ounce of credit for all that he does.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve never heard Andy use the word “I” when it comes to what he loves to do for UConn Football or for that matter anything that he does for all of us former players.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have been blessed with a chance to come back to be part of UConn Football again after years and decades off the playing field. Andy has created this “family” from nothing and built it to become a caring and close knit group.  We all look forward to these events and Andy has been our guide and leader though it all.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I left the “Farewell to Memorial Stadium Event”, I thanked Andy for the day, but for me it wasn’t enough. I wanted to write this and express how we all feel about Andy.
    </p>
    <p>
        So on behalf of ALL the UConn Football Alumni and current players, coaches and support staff-
    </p>
    <p>
        THANK YOU ANDY!
    </p>
    <p>
        For all that you have done for UConn Football, for your guidance, support and love as we took our first steps on campus to our last steps in life.
    </p>
    <p>
        God Bless you always!

        I think of you not just as a coach but as an outstanding friend, individual and representative of the University of Connecticut. While you coached the team you were always concerned with players as individuals. You made it a point to keep in touch with former athletes and have done so with me for more than 55 years. I am proud to know you, Andy Baylock.

        You have been a great inspiration to me since I first met you when you recruited me back in 1966.  I was called out of class to meet with you and my high school coach/teacher.  I’ll never forget your enthusiasm for UConn and how you bled blue even then.  I was sold.  You have led a charmed life and influenced 1000’s of kids …. and are still able to name them all, along with a little insightful story about them.  Amazing!  My favorite is Coach Toner buying you the best steak you ever had on your way back to Storrs after you guys came to my house.  That was 57 years ago.  I can’t remember what I did yesterday.  I am thankful for you being in my life, have and will continue to cherish our friendship.

You continuously were willing to share your vast knowledge of UConn Athletics, Baseball, Football, etc., and that helped me more than you know.  Listening to your legendary stories made me the happiest and they stick with me still.  Your stories are legendary, and so are YOU.  Your kindness and generosity extend well beyond UConn. I can only imagine the thousands of lives you’ve touched.  But I want you to know that you ARE UConn Athletics for me.  The one constant in my past and present happy thoughts of UConn Football.

        I have always been astounded how great a coach you have been to so many for so long. No doubt you remember all the baseball and football players you had over the years. Your toughness and kindness know no bounds. You always seemed to get the most out of players by providing encouragement and excellent challenges. I never ever witnessed you belittle any player, anyone – ever. About eight years ago I happened to be at UConn, and I thought of visiting you. I had not seen you in many decades. The building was locked but a person let me in, and I went up to a secretary and asked if Coach Baylock was in. Instantly, down the hall you bellowed: “Is that Brian Hermes?” You jumped out of your room, we hugged, and then you took me on a grand tour of the new facilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are the best.

        I can remember the first time I met you in 1964, you were bigger than life itself.  You have continued to be a bigger than life role model for all those that were fortunate enough to come into contact with you.  You have been responsible for many things in my life from talking me into staying with the program, telling me about my first Head Coaching job at Plainfield High School when I returned from the Service, to teaching me how to study and live by a simple “To Do” list every day.  However, the most important take away from you was learning how to treat people with respect, loyalty and a never-ending work ethic.

        Coach Baylock, you offered nothing but love to me since I met you for the first time ever at the age of 12 during goaline, the program you ran that was major in my school and had a positive impact on my peers. Being blessed enough to follow my dreams and play for UConn through the years of 2018-2022 you were there side by side everyday pouring nothing but positivity and wisdom on me every time we spoke. You lectured me on life, advice on my game and how to continue growing as a young man, and you told me things about East Hartford back in the day that I knew nothing about which was always funny to hear. I can’t thank you enough Coach, you are the epitome of UConn football. I love you and I’m grateful to have you as a resource in my life.

        As a member of Coach Baylock’s first freshman football team in 1964, one thing hasn’t changed much for Coach B over the years. The 105 freshmen players probably were among the first entries into Coach B’s legendary “database”, a paper rolodex file that must have thousands of entries today.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fast forward to today and certainly automation helps Coach B. with his football duties. But that personal touch is still there as he continues to use his rolodex file to keep in touch with all of us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Until recently, Coach mailed us the newsletter and always included a hand written greeting on the front page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, the football news letter is electronically emailed to us. But the Coach Baylock personal connection with all of us still happens in different ways. It can be at the football alumni tent on a game day. Another can be a piece of mail with a note and picture with you and teammates pulled out of his files. Or sometimes Coach makes an off-season phone call which will usually include a few Husky football stories.
    </p>
    <p>
        On Thursday, August 31, 2023, we will have a chance to publicly show our appreciation for all that Coach Baylock has done for the University of Connecticut and Husky football.
    </p>
    <p>
        His tireless effort to keep football alumni and today’s football team members connected is so appreciated. We’ll have a chance to express our gratitude for his connection to all of us during his special game night and I know that appreciation will continue well beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you, Coach Andy Baylock for your friendship from that freshman season in 1964. All the best in the future as you provide a link to Husky football – past and present.

        To Uncle Gramps,
    </p>
    <p>
        Man, where do I start? Coach, you are the epitome of man who has experienced true happiness in his life. This comes from the amount of people you’ve influenced, mentored, and uplifted with just a mere smile or 2-minute convo that has created a ripple effect and impact far beyond the football field and UConn campus.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every time I asked how you were doing, you would swiftly reply, “You know, not so bad for an old man. But I can still kick your ass!” I’ll hand it to you coach, the way you approached every day with a positive mindset sometimes made me actually believe you could. Haha
    </p>
    <p>
        Since day 1, you commented on the fact that I am always smiling. “We don’t want no pickle puss’s around here,” as you would say. Well coach, the reason for me smiling when I saw you was because I truly saw your superpower which was your heart and spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am honored to have walked the hallways with you and shared a couple of laughs. Love you man and thank you.

        Courtney Robinson, incoming freshman class by the way of Florida back in ’05. I want to take a second just to say, “Thank You”. Even as a transfer you’ve always been a standup guy and over the years we still stayed in contact and getting as many youth on campus as possible here in the state.

    <p>
        You granted my wish 50 years ago to be a part of UConn football. If you were ambivalent about it, you never showed it. I learned a lot about the game, about discipline, about showing up from you. You cut me no slack, but treated me with kindness and respect.  When I remember my years at UConn, I think of football first and the lifelong friends I made because of football. You taught us all life lessons, made us accountable, encouraged us when we needed it and reminded us to make our parents proud. You made me feel like a part of the family. No visit to UConn is complete without a hug from you. It was an experience that I will never forget and will always cherish. Enjoy your special day. ❤️

        Congratulations and thank you for the positive impact and lifelong lessons you given to generations of Huskies!!
    </p>
    <p>
        As a 18 year old out of state kid who tore up his knee 45 days into his college career, your help and guidance made a huge difference in my ability to move forward. Being told I may not be able to play again, my sole purpose for going to school, you taught me early life lessons. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday you would show up in the station wagon at 7:45 to make sure I would get to class on time. This along with your study hall put me on a different path than when I showed up in August. You helped give me a different perspective and purpose in life. I know you have had a similar impact on hundreds of us over the years. You are truly a special person.
    </p>

The particulars of the games (or the plays we ran on the scout team 😊) have long faded from memory. However, the life lessons you taught and the example you set, have remained with me all of my life.

You’re someone that I looked up to from the day we met, and then I became your bodyguard, (I took that job seriously, LOL). You have a long life ahead of you and I assume you will still be at UConn, one way or another. They can’t get rid of you that easily.

    <p>
        I cannot even begin to find the right words to express how thankful I am for you. From the first day I stepped on campus and became a member of the UConn Football Family, you offered me advice and gave me the tools to help me become the best student-athlete I possibly could. From watching over my countless snaps during practice, to giving me words of encouragement to help me become a better leader, you were always there for me. After five years, two degrees, and the opportunity to accomplish my dream of becoming a UConn Husky, I am eternally grateful for your kindness and positivity. Thank you for all that I have done and will continue to do for UConn Football and UConn Athletics.

        Coach Baylock isn’t just the kindest and most joyful man in UConn history… he’s one of the toughest too. One of my earliest UConn Football memories was when we got our first day off from summer camp back in ‘06, and Coach B was pitcher for the softball game we played. He took a softball right off the shin bone and it swelled up as big as the softball that hit him! But he shrugged it off like it was nothing and kept pitching, with, somehow, and even bigger smile than he normally sports.

        Coach Baylock has been one of the most influential people in my life. I consider him to be in the top five people of all time for me. From the time I stepped on the field in 1971 until now, he has always been there for me. I can remember a few years ago, speaking with him and he could remember a play that I made against the University of Maine on the end sweep. I can’t remember what I had for lunch yesterday! I have 11 grand-kids and all I want for them is to be decent humans. Coach Baylock is one of the most decent humans I have ever met.

As long as you bled blue, you welcomed us. You will always hold a special place in my heart because of the HUGE heart you have. You would give rides to players that were injured to make sure they got to places on time. You would hold steak dinners at your house for guys that made the honor role. That’s the type of heart you have. Poppa Bear, you will forever be my favorite all time person from the UConn staff. Love you Coach Baylock. I know you can still kick some ass if needed. Ha ha!

I was one of the fortunate players who got to be with you not only in Football, but 4 years in Baseball, culminating with our trip to the College World Series in 1972.  I have such wonderful memories and I’m glad you are finally being recognized by  the University. You are one of a kind, a great person and a wonderful friend to us all. Thank you for all you have done.  With utmost respect……..

I remember you advising all of the young pups, pushing us to be promising future leaders, helping us achieve and focus on not only being great football players, but college graduates as well. The best quality that Coach Bear brings to the UConn family would be all of his hard work with the alumni. Keeping the UConn family together by emails, phone calls, and invites to football games. It’s amazing what Coach Baylock brings to the UConn nation and we love him dearly, and thank him for all of his dedication to the husky family!

        Just a short message to you Coach because you need to know that anyone who was touched by your leadership emerged as a better person. 1964 is 59 years behind us and the warm feelings of your enthusiasm, encouragement and kindness live on in me, probably the least qualified guy ever to have the opportunity to play for you. Coach, your reach, while centered in Storrs, goes far and deep into the character of your players. You are, and always have been, a class act.

    </p>
    <p>
        I want to thank you for all you have done for me during my time at UConn and as an alumnus. The establishment of this foundation could not go to a more deserving man. Kenny has done a superb job of getting it off the ground. Personally, my time playing for you was my best and helped me countless times in my life. There were some very talented players at UC, of which I probably was not one. But, to this day, you always treated me as one. In retrospect, you treated us all as stars. I have coached many sports from youth to juco level baseball and always made it a point to treat all players and families as you did us. I’ll never forget the afternoon of your time you gave me a few years ago when I came up for a visit. It really brought me to tears and reinforced the kind of man you are. Congratulations and enjoy your most deserved honor.

        “4th and 1, what are you going to do?” Your last year coaching football in 1978 was my first and you were my position coach for part of the season. I also had you as a teacher for one of my first classes in PE. Fast forward to 2003 when you were reengaged with the football program which has been a wonderful run getting former players involved in the program to mentor future Huskies, solidifying bonds with former players and creating a community which did not exist before. Your dedication to the university and most importantly the former players (whether star players, or like me, having a short career) has been stellar.

        Having left Coach Naviaux’s office during my recruiting visit, my grandmother said to me, “Anthony, I want you to come here. That man is the only one to have spoken about you graduating.” Graduation, was a hope and a prayer; however, with the study hall lectures that fall, along with you monitoring my stadium stairs reminders for penalties after practice, (lol,) I was on the road to eventually learning how to learn. I sincerely want to know that through the years, all I have tried to do is to pay your fine example forward during my career teaching and coaching. You have been a very special blessing in my life, and I love you for that. God bless you, Coach.

        You are truly an all-time UConn great because of the positive impact you have had upon so many people throughout your career.  You have been a leader and an ambassador for both the baseball and football programs at UConn, as well as the University at large.  So much of the wit and wisdom you imparted upon us on the field or in the freshmen study halls still rings true today. That’s impactful!!!
    </p>
    <p>
        I wonder if while watching a practice you still say, “Good try, but make the play.”  Throughout your career you taught us “to make the play.”  You did it by being respectful, responsible, truthful, compassionate, and committed and instilling those traits into your players.
    </p>
    <p>
        You’ve been “making the plays” for countless individuals and the University for over a half a century. We are forever grateful.

    <p>
        I wanted to send this message to let you know how much of a big influence you were in my life and how much being part of the UConn baseball program helped to shape my life.  First, I wanted to thank you for always believing in me as a person.  With my struggles my first two years, coming from a small town to a division 1 program, it would’ve been easy to give up on me. However, you never did and despite thinking my playing days at UConn might be over, you suggested I change my delivery and become the Side-Arm pitcher, which I embraced, and ultimately ended up having a successful UConn career.  Coach, I credit you for having that belief in me and thinking out of the box and just wanted to thank you for that opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Secondly, I also wanted to thank you for instilling the ethics of hard work, being on time, and the importance of education.  To this day, I still use some of your techniques that you taught us, including reading techniques involving reading the first and last sentence of a paragraph when reading a book, etc.  Your instruction in time management, and your focus on our academic success really helped me to be able to concurrently manage both playing baseball and successfully completing a physical therapy degree, as well as leading to a successful career in physical therapy after school.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thanks again for everything and congratulations!

        Dear Coach,
    </p>
    <p>
        Every student I have taught and every athlete I have coached has a little Andy Baylock in them. You came into my life in 1966 as My Freshman Football and Baseball Coach and helped me build a strong foundation of leadership and academic skill. For the next three years on the varsity level, I continued to observe firsthand how well you treated people with respect and love. You have always been a great role model and I wanted, and still want, to be like you.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will always remember the day you called me into your office and asked me “Where did the quiet Italian kid from Newton Go?” You took great pride in checking up on us all and fixing situations before they went off the rails. One of the greatest compliments I ever received is when you asked me to babysit your children. I was honored that I had won your trust. In addition, you and Mrs. Baylock provided a Study Hall program that improved our study skills and grades. Also, your reference letter to the University of Michigan helped me secure a Fellowship. Receiving a copy of that letter from you, 53 years later, nearly brought me to tears.
    </p>
    <p>
        I feel honored to join the many former athletes, families and friends, whose lives you have touched and enriched. I take great joy telling “Coach Baylock” stories to the Coaching Classes I teach, and to the Football Players and Wrestler’s I have coached. Above all, I appreciate the outpouring of interest and love you continue to give us all.
    </p>

You also inspire me with your constant urge to stay active as life moves on.  I aspire to this – thank you for all that you do for us

The countless meetings over the years just to see how I’m doing helped me make it through being homesick. Speaking to you and finding out the knowledge you had about my hometown blew me away. You’ve traveled all walks of life with sports.  Your welcoming nature and caring attitude left a long lasting impression on anyone that crossed paths with you. UConn has been blessed to have you apart of their University.  You are one of a kind. Thank you for everything my guy.

        You could receive all of the honors in the world and it still wouldn’t be nearly enough to recognize all you have done for UConn football, the entire athletic program, and the school in general.  UConn football is truly a brotherhood, and you are the glue that holds it all together.  My family and I love coming up to campus and visiting, one of the highlights is when we see you and ask you how you are doing, you enthusiastically reply “not too bad for an old guy!”  Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for all you have done for me, my UConn football brothers, and the entire program.  Many things have changed over the years, but you have been the one thing that has remained steady.  I look forward to many more years of coming to campus and taking tours around the facilities.  Go Huskies!

        My last season at UConn was in 2006, and many things have changed since then.  The one thing that remains the same with UConn Football is Coach Baylock’s presence.  It’s impossible to put into words how valuable he is to the program & adequately thank him for the positive impact he’s had on thousands of athletes while at UConn and their lives after their athletic careers end.  One of many things I admire about Coach Baylock is that he treats the All-American Running Back with the same level of respect as the walk-on trying to earn a spot on the team.  Coach Baylock’s memory is second to none.  He will remember the high school you went to and will inevitably have a story about that school/town/head football coach.  Periodically Coach Baylock will leave me a voicemail.  The most recent one was from January of ‘22.  It is just over 2 minutes long.  This message is an update on how things are with the program.  The passion, energy, and excitement in his voice are incredible.  I have the message saved and listen to it periodically.  He embodies everything right with college sports.  Coach B, thank you for selflessly giving your time to the program- keep it up, we need you & appreciate you!

    <p>
        I’m turning 68 this year and with it comes the anniversary of my high school graduation 50 years ago but more importantly, it is the 50-year anniversary of my arrival at UCONN.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was selected to be in the “early arrival” group of freshman Husky Pups. That meant my first exposure to UCONN was with 14 freshman teammates from all over the Northeast. I think this was a 2-week program before the rest of the freshman footballers and the rest of the freshman class joined us.
    </p>
    <p>
        What I would like to express to you is that becoming part of the UCONN freshman football team was one of the greatest and most memorable life experiences for me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Teams normally are remembered for, and celebrate, winning. I was part of a state championship high school baseball team and I cherished that experience. We still have team reunions and celebrate our success. In high school, especially in a small town, everyone has shared and common experiences in growing up together. Most of the guys on our high school team played Little League, and Babe Ruth on the same fields. We knew each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        Getting to UCONN to meet and team with 49 guys from different backgrounds, different cities and states was exposure to a new and different dynamic. Very few of us knew one another. Pulling the various personalities and characters together into a cohesive unit was a great credit to the coaching staff. That process got us all to know one other, support each other and find a way to get along with each other. That time and experience was not only memorable but was invaluable in my maturation into adulthood.
    </p>
    <p>
        Coach, you have dedicated your career to UCONN and continue to support the program. What I am trying to say is that, for me, even without lettering or finishing in the program, there are great memories of those times and especially my teammates and coaches.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you for reaching out to me to become a Husky and all the support you gave to me in the program and continue to give, to every Husky, today.
    </p>

        Thanks so much for being you! You have been a support and friend since my days playing for you as a frosh! Am eternally grateful for all you have done! I never forgot my Soph year when you knew I was on crutches and cast. You personally picked me up at McMahon and drove me to my Anatomy Lab class as you knew I had to get there studying to be a Physical Therapist. The snow and ice was beyond belief! I truly can  say, I love you man! This is a well deserved honor and I will be flying from Wisconsin to celebrate you!

    <p>
        Congratulations on such a successful career at UCONN!  You have touched so many lives in a heartfelt and down to earth way! For me personally, anytime I’ve ever needed anything you have always done whatever you could. Thank you for all your years of service to UCONN athletics!

        Dear Coach Baylock,
    </p>
    <p>
        I want to extend my sincere appreciation for all the memories you have provided all of us  over the years. Your tireless efforts to build a UConn football community over the last fifty years is being recognized today in ways that only express the “tip of the iceberg” in emotions we collectively share with you. We all have been blessed to have had you in our life when it counted the most and for that I am eternally grateful.
    </p>

        With gratitude,

        Some words that I thought describes Andy
    </p>
    <p>
        Andy Baylock: one of the finest human beings one is fortunate to come in contact with.  He is a man of integrity, passion, humility, generosity, compassion, selflessness, and giving.   Those are just some of the words that aptly describe Coach.  Not only was Andy our Coach but he is a friend to all of us in every sense of the word.  Coach, thanks for being you!

        Coach Baylock,
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout your life, you have demonstrated how much you truly love your players. We thank you for your patience and continued support. You’ve always been available to help us in our time of need. Your former players appreciate your thoughtfulness and are delighted to learn that Governor Lamont will be issuing you a proclamation from the State of Connecticut thanking you for your years of devoted and unselfish service to the students, faculty and administration of the University of Connecticut.
    </p>
    <p>
        What a truly awesome honor and accomplishment !!!
    </p>
    <p>
        I want to extend my hearty gratitude to you, as my mentor and coach. I appreciate how much you’ve taught me and how you’ve helped further my education in Life. You are one of three people who made a profound impact on my life.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I arrived at UConn during the Fall of 1966, I was a young, socially unsophisticated youth from Danielson, Connecticut. Danielson, certainly, was not known as the cradle for the birthing of college football players. All the players who proceeded me from Killingly High School, with the exception of Norm Chartier, became academically ineligible and their football careers ended. When I arrived on campus, I was determined to prove that I could become an academically sound and credible football player.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I met you, Coach Baylock, I learned the true definition of a “Coach”. You were an inspiration and a mentor to us as young men. You were the first coach I ever met who wasn’t just interested in how each player could contribute to the team’s success on the football field. You were interested in our success in becoming honorable, responsible and committed young men. For many of us, you were the first Christian man we met who “walked the talk”. You taught us the importance of a college education. Though we had the privilege to play football; we had an even greater opportunity and responsibility to earn an education that would determine our success in life as businessmen, husbands, fathers and grandfathers.
    </p>
    <p>
        You taught us how to study and properly allocate time during our busy days to prepare for our classroom responsibilities. During our first week, you gave us a mimeographed chart exhibiting all 24 hours in a day. I remember saying to myself, “WOW, there is a lot of time in a day. I can and will find the time I need to succeed in my studies.”  You also encouraged us to attend all our classes on a regular basis and to sit in the front row so all the professors knew who we were — that we were attentive and in attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was a freshman player who never made it to the finish line — or should I say “goal line”. I was injured during our first freshman game at Boston University. As a result, I was never able to complete my aspirations to become a UCONN Huskie Football Player.
    </p>
    <p>
        Though I did not meet my goals in becoming an accomplished football player during my college career, I used your lessons to become the President of the Class of 1970, President of ARCHONS Leadership Honor Society, President of the Yankee Conference Student Government Council, recipient of the University of Connecticut U.S. Congress Intern Scholarship and received the honor of being the 1970 Killingly High School Commencement Speaker. (The high school I graduated from four years earlier.)
    </p>
    <p>
        I also thank you for submitting a letter of recommendation for me to attend law school after my UCONN college career.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am now retired; but enjoyed a successful business career. The highlight being an expert witness for a U.S. Presidential National Leadership Commission on Health Care. Though I was a player for only a short period of time, I couldn’t have come this far without your mentoring and fine example. You emphasized incorporating courage, sacrifice and humility into our character. I attempted to follow your teachings not only during college; but, throughout my adult life.
    </p>
    <p>
        You not only positively impacted the lives of thousands of players; I am confident you also positively impacted the lives of many other non-players like me. These are the qualities of a true “COACH”.
    </p>
    <p>
        I thank you, Coach Baylock, for all you have done for me !!!
    </p>
    <p>
        Blessings to you and your Family !!!
    </p>
    <p>
        With Respect & Admiration,
